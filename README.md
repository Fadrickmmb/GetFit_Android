Get Fit is a calorie counter that will serve as a guide and helper to lose weight in a healthy way. Everybody knows that the best way to lose weight is to have a calorie deficit, which means ingesting less calories than you burn on a daily basis. Get Fit will help the user with that, since it will not only show the user the number of calories they ingest, but will also help them stay healthy, showing the major macronutrients in each of their meals.

The person will be able to track their diet, by accessing their diet history, that will be shown in a separate page, alerting for any warnings they might have, such as having ingested too much or too little of a macronutrient, such as proteins, fibers or fat, for example.


Built in Java, for Android, using Firebase Auth for authentication and Firebase Realtime Database for storing user data.

The app allows the user to create calorie goals, and track their goal throughout the day, based on the meals they ingested.
